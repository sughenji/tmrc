# Exploit Title: Docker Daemon - Local Privilege Escalation
# Date: 12 august 2020
# Exploit Author: flast101
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.docker.com/
# Software Link: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
# Version: all 
# Tested on: tested on version 19.03.7, build 7141c19
# CVE : N/A

# This is a known trick abusing badly configured machines with Docker. This script 
# obtains root privileges from any host account with access to the Docker daemon, 
# and creates a new root user by entering it directly in the /etc/passwd file with the creds 
# you provide. Usually this includes (but not only) accounts in the "docker" group.
#  
# Requirements:
#    - Access to a shell on the target with a user that can run Docker.
#    - The target should have either an internet connection or an image installed in Docker. Use 
#      docker images to check and change the “alpine” image accordingly. If there is no image go 
#      to https://hub.docker.com to get one (tar.gz file with its Dockerfile) and upload it on the 
#      target in your working directory.
